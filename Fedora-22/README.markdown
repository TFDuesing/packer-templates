Fedora-22
=========

This Packer template can be used to build minimal Fedora 22 base boxes for Vagrant’s VirtualBox and VMware providers, starting from Fedora 22 Server’s netinstall ISO for x86_64 architectures.

Vagrant base boxes built from this template can be downloaded from [Atlas][1] directly, or by running `vagrant init TFDuesing/Fedora-22`.
