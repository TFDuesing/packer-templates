Fedora-20
=========

This Packer template can be used to build a minimal Fedora 20 base box for Vagrant, starting from Fedora’s “Install DVD” ISO for x86_64 architectures.

A Vagrant base box built from this template can be downloaded at http://files.tfduesing.net/Fedora-20-x86_64-virtualbox.box, or from [Vagrant Cloud][1] by running `vagrant init TFDuesing/Fedora-20`.
