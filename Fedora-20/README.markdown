Fedora-20
=========

This Packer template can be used to build minimal Fedora 20 base boxes for Vagrant’s VirtualBox and VMware providers, starting from Fedora’s “Install DVD” ISO for x86_64 architectures.

Vagrant base boxes built from this template can be downloaded from [Atlas][1] directly, or by running `vagrant init TFDuesing/Fedora-20`.
