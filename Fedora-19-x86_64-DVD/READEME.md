Fedora-19-x86_64-DVD
====================

This template can be used to build a minimal Fedora 19 base box from Fedora’s
“Install DVD” ISO for x86_64 architectures.

The build process for this template is front-loaded, so it will take longer
than the network install for one run, but will be more efficient over multiple
runs.  Also, generally speaking, this template will produce larger images than
the network install.
