Fedora-21
=========

This Packer template can be used to build minimal Fedora 21 base boxes for Vagrant’s VirtualBox and VMware providers, starting from Fedora 21 Server’s netinstall ISO for x86_64 architectures.

Vagrant base boxes built from this template can be downloaded from [Atlas][1] directly, or by running `vagrant init TFDuesing/Fedora-21`.
