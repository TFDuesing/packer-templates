Fedora-19-x86_64-netinst
========================

This template can be used to build a minimal Fedora 19 base box from Fedora’s
“Network Install CD” ISO for x86_64 architectures.

The build process for this template will be shorter than the install DVD for
one run, but will be less efficient over multiple runs.  Also, generally
speaking, this template will produce smaller boxes than the install DVD.
